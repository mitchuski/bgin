## Core Principles

1. **The gap between Swordsman and Mage is sacred** — no feature collapses it
2. **Agreements before access** — no data exchange without bilateral MyTerms agreement
3. **Promises, not impositions** — all commitments voluntary
4. **Personal first, collaborative second** — value from Mages before workspace
5. **Local-first data sovereignty** — participant device first, sync optional
6. **Knowledge before trust** — learning comes first

---

*The blade guards. The mage guides. The promise binds. The trust emerges.*

*Ship sovereign governance for Block #14.*
