# BGIN AI Block 14 Frontend Rebuild — Coding Agent Package

## What This Is

Documentation package for rebuilding the BGIN AI frontend aligned with the agentprivacy "Three Graphs, One Identity" architecture. Read ALL files before writing code.

| 01_ARCHITECTURE.md | System architecture, data flow, component relationships |
| 02_KEY_CEREMONY.md | Swordsman agent generation — onboarding flow |
| 03_MAGE_AGENTS.md | Working Group Mage interfaces — RAG, chat, memory |
| 04_PERSONAL_CURATION.md | Personal dashboard and meta-Mage layer |
| 05_COLLABORATIVE_WORKSPACE.md | Promise graph interface, shared docs |
| 06_TRUST_DISPLAY.md | Trust tier system and graph visualization |
| 07_API_SPEC.md | All API endpoints, request/response schemas |
| 08_DATA_MODELS.md | Database schemas, graph structures, storage |
| 09_MIGRATION.md | Migration from existing bgin-homepage |
| 10_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md | UI patterns, component library, visual language |
| 11_BONFIRES_INTEGRATION.md | Bonfires.ai as alternative/complementary knowledge graph provider |
| 12_SOULBAE_CASE_STUDY.md | Case study: deploying Soulbae through Bonfires — lessons for BGIN |
| 13_MYTERMS_AGREEMENT_LAYER.md | IEEE 7012 bilateral agreements — the Swordsman's first blade |

## Reading Order

1. `01_ARCHITECTURE.md` — full system before touching components
2. `09_MIGRATION.md` — what exists and what changes
3. `08_DATA_MODELS.md` — data layer
4. `07_API_SPEC.md` — API surface
5. `13_MYTERMS_AGREEMENT_LAYER.md` — the agreement layer beneath all three graphs
6. Component specs (02-06) as you build each feature
7. `11_BONFIRES_INTEGRATION.md` — alternative knowledge graph architecture using Bonfires.ai
8. `12_SOULBAE_CASE_STUDY.md` — case study informing the Bonfires integration decisions
9. `10_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — reference throughout

## Core Principles (DO NOT VIOLATE)

1. **The gap between Swordsman and Mage is sacred** — no feature collapses it
2. **Agreements before access** — no data exchange without bilateral MyTerms agreement
3. **Promises, not impositions** — all commitments voluntary
4. **Personal first, collaborative second** — value from Mages before workspace
5. **Local-first data sovereignty** — participant device first, sync optional
6. **Knowledge before trust** — learning comes first

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (TypeScript) — fork from bgin-homepage
- **AI:** Claude API (Anthropic) for Mage conversational interfaces
- **Vector DB:** Qdrant (self-hosted) or Pinecone
- **Graph DB:** Neo4j for relationship traversal
- **Key Management:** WebCrypto API
- **Local Storage:** IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **Sync:** CRDTs (Yjs) for collaborative features
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Knowledge Graph (Option B):** Bonfires.ai — Delve intake, bounded agENTs, Knowledge Network
  - See 11_BONFIRES_INTEGRATION.md for integration options
  - Provides graph-level separation guarantees (validated via Soulbae deployment)
  - Adds $KNOW token economy, stigmergic traces, Hyperblogs

## Working Groups → Mages

| Working Group | Mage | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| IKP | 🔐 IKP Mage | Privacy, identity, wallets, credentials, key management |
| FASE | 💎 FASE Mage | DeFi, stablecoins, CBDCs, financial regulation |
| Cybersecurity | 🛡️ Cyber Mage | Threat sharing, incident response, security standards |
| Governance | 🏛️ Governance Mage | Bylaws, org structure, decision-making |

## Three Graphs Model

```
KNOWLEDGE GRAPH (Substrate)
    ↓ what you engage with
PROMISE GRAPH (Overlay)
    ↓ what you commit to
TRUST GRAPH (Emergent)
    ↓ what you've proven

Unique intersection = participant identity
```

## The Duality

- **Swordsman ⚔️** — Generated at key ceremony. Client-side. Guards privacy boundaries. Enforces Chatham House cryptographically.
- **Mage 🧙** — One per working group, shared. Server-side RAG. Navigates collective knowledge. Never sees what Swordsman hides.

The gap between them is where governance happens.
