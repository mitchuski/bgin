# Block 14 specification

The full Block 14 coding agent package is **00_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** (master roadmap) plus **01–13** in the **block14_updates** directory.

- **Start with 00_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** — phases, steps, and deliverables.
- If this repo lives under `BGINAI`, the spec is at **`../block14_updates`** (sibling folder).
- Implementation in this repo (`BGINAI_Block14`) follows 00 and the reading order in the root README.

All implementation must align with those specs.
