# BGIN AI — Block 14

Governance intelligence for the BGIN constellation: **Three Graphs, One Identity**. Sovereign participant identity sits at the intersection of knowledge, promises, and trust. This app is the Block 14–oriented frontend and API layer—ceremony, Mages, Spellbook, promises, and Archive—with the implementation flow **mid–in progress**.

---

## What this is

- **Block 14** — Homepage with timetable (March 1–2, 2026), links into sessions and Spellbook; Get started and promise/cast feeds on the side.
- **Ceremony** — 8-step key ceremony: keygen, privacy preferences, MyTerms, working-group selection, agent card. Completing it gives you a Swordsman-style identity and unlocks Mages, Spellbook, and promises.
- **Archive** — Knowledge tab: Talk to a Mage (by WG), Block 14 briefings, Knowledge map, and **Knowledge** (BGIN publications & projects from [bgin-global.org/projects](https://bgin-global.org/projects)), sorted by most recent.
- **Spellbook** — Promises, **Sessions** (cast by timetable session), **Spellbooks** (by working group), and **Recent casts**; all sections expandable. The **Spellweb** tab shows an interactive graph (constellation view or draw mode to add your own links). Casts come from Mage chat (Cast to session / Cast to spellbook). Each cast can have **✦ Inscribe proverb** to agree or add a proverb.
- **Mage** — WG-specific chat (IKP, FASE, Cyber, Governance). Open via the **🧙** header button (side panel) or from Archive. Optional **RPP** (Relationship Proverb Protocol): Mage first divines a proverb connecting your context to the tale, then responds. After each reply: **Cast to session**, **Cast to spellbook**, or **✦ Inscribe proverb**.
- **Proverbs** (`/proverb`) — Feed of proverbs (from Mage inscriptions, or inscribed on casts). Filters by WG. Connects proof of understanding to the knowledge-sharing system; proverbs linked to casts and promises strengthen the trust graph.
- **Promises** — Single `/promises` page for all WGs; voluntary commitments and assessment flows. When creating a promise you can optionally **connect a proverb** (proof of understanding) to the commitment; it appears on the promise card and is signed with the promise.
- **Profile** — Swordsman identity, working groups, **My proverbs** and **My casts** (expandable), Community (Discourse), Settings.

The **implementation flow** (phases from the master plan) is **mid–working**: core ceremony, Mage chat, Spellbook, promises, and Archive are in place; trust graph, full MyTerms wiring, and some integrations are still in progress or stubbed.

## Master plan and specs

The step-by-step roadmap is **`00_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`** (Phases 0–12). All work in this repo aligns with it. Specs live in **`block14_updates/`** (sibling to `BGINAI`, or your local copy). Suggested reading order:

1. **00_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** — Full roadmap, phases, priorities  
2. **01_ARCHITECTURE.md** — System overview, Swordsman/Mage duality  
3. **09_MIGRATION.md** — What to keep, add, directory structure  
4. **07_API_SPEC.md** — API surface  
5. **08_DATA_MODELS.md** — PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Neo4j, IndexedDB  
6. Component and integration specs (02–06, 10–13) as you build

## Implementation phases (from 00)

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Foundation & infra | ✅ |
| 1 | Swordsman layer | ✅ |
| 2 | Key ceremony UI | ✅ |
| 3 | Backend API | ✅ (auth, register, sessions, spellbook, promises) |
| 4 | Knowledge graph | 🔄 Ingress/RAG mid–working |
| 5 | Mage chat | ✅ (hub, chat, panel, cast to session/spellbook) |
| 6 | Personal dashboard | ✅ (feed, briefing, knowledge map → Archive) |
| 7 | Collaborative workspace | ✅ (promises, spellbook; codex/drafts stubbed) |
| 8 | Trust display | 🔄 Stubs in place |
| 9 | Design system | 🔄 Theme and layout in use |
| 10 | Integration & polish | 🔄 Ongoing |
| 11–12 | Testing & rollout | Planned |

## Core principles (do not violate)

- The **gap between Swordsman and Mage is sacred** — no feature collapses it.
- **Agreements before access** — no data exchange without bilateral MyTerms.
- **Promises, not impositions** — all commitments voluntary.
- **Personal first, collaborative second** — value from Mages before workspace.
- **Local-first data sovereignty** — participant device first, sync optional.

---

## Tech stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (TypeScript), App Router  
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Workers via [OpenNext for Cloudflare](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare) (see [Deployment](#deployment) below)  
- **AI:** Anthropic (Claude) or NEAR Cloud AI for Mage; set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `NEAR_AI_API_KEY` in `.env`  
- **Key management:** WebCrypto API (Ed25519)  
- **Local storage:** IndexedDB via Dexie.js  
- **Server state:** File-based (`.data/store.json`, `.data/collaborative-sessions.json`) for dev; PostgreSQL etc. per 08 for production  
- **Vector/graph:** Qdrant, Neo4j (per plan); ingestion and RAG mid–working

## Commands

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or NEAR_AI_API_KEY
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint
```

**Deployment (Cloudflare Workers):**

```bash
npm run build          # build Next.js first
npm run deploy         # deploy to Cloudflare (OpenNext; worker name: bgin-ai)
npm run preview        # build + local preview with Wrangler
```

Requires **Node.js ≥ 18**. See [Deployment](#deployment) and **docs/CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN_SETUP.md** for custom domains and CI setup.

---

## Deployment

The app deploys as a **Cloudflare Worker** (name: `bgin-ai`) using [OpenNext for Cloudflare](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare). Configuration: `wrangler.jsonc`, `open-next.config.ts`.

- **Local deploy:** `npm run build` then `npm run deploy` (requires [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) auth: `npx wrangler login`).
- **CI (e.g. Cloudflare build):** Set **Build command** to `npm run build`, **Deploy command** to `npm run deploy`.
- **Custom domain:** Attach your domain in [Workers & Pages](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → **bgin-ai** → Settings → Domains & Routes, or add `routes` in `wrangler.jsonc`. Full steps: **docs/CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN_SETUP.md**.
